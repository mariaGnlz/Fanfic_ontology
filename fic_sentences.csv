1744,ROMANCE,50,Neutral," Furthermore , he had eyes .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,51,Positive," Until Egypt he had n’t been certain that Aziraphale loved him , too , but he ’d always had hope .","[3, 9]","[229, 287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,52,Positive," Aziraphale , on the other hand , could n’t afford that hope .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,53,Neutral," To have hope that Crowley could love him would mean acknowledging that he and Crowley were the same , that Crowley did n’t deserve Hell any more than Aziraphale did — and perhaps that Aziraphale deserved it more , because deep , deep down , in a part of himself he ’d locked away , he did n’t believe in Heaven ’s inherent goodness anymore than Crowley did .","[9, 3, 84]","[410, 287, 246, 248, 253]"
1744,ROMANCE,54,Neutral," But Aziraphale could n’t let himself acknowledge that , because he was an angel .","[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,55,Negative," He was also a stubborn bastard , which was why he was so able to convince himself Crowley could n’t love him that he drowned in flower petals every time they got too close .",[9],"[410, 267]"
1744,ROMANCE,57,Positive," “ Angel , seriously , Heaven is going to start asking questions if you keep leaving corpses stuffed with daisies everywhere you go , ” said Crowley as he watched Aziraphale retch in an alley just off the Forum .",[9],"[410, 301, 287, 282, 283, 475]"
1744,ROMANCE,61,Neutral, Aziraphale looked up from the petals on the ground and glared at him .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,65,Neutral, He stood up straight and crossed his arms .,[103],[306]
1744,ROMANCE,67,Negative, Crowley let out a loud grunt of frustration .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,68,Negative," “ Would it really be so bad , Aziraphale ?",[3],"[287, 315]"
1744,ROMANCE,70,Negative," “ Perhaps , ” said Aziraphale , “ but it ’s not one to which you can be the solution . ”",[3],"[287, 324, 326, 301]"
1744,ROMANCE,71,Neutral," And then , as though underlining his point , he bent over and regurgitated an entire striped carnation .",[108],[349]
1744,ROMANCE,74,Neutral, Crowley shouted .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,76,Neutral," And with that , he stormed off .",[108],"[349, 336]"

1744,ROMANCE,78,Positive," He simply stared at Aziraphale , one eyebrow fixed condescendingly in place , and let the silence speak for him .",[108],"[287, 346, 349]"
1744,ROMANCE,79,Neutral," He did n’t say anything when he started coughing up bouquets of wallflowers as they sealed their Arrangement , or snowdrops when the commiserated over the fourteenth century , or hydrangeas when Crowley bit the bullet and moved from Italy to London to be closer to Aziraphale in the fifteenth .","[9, 108]","[352, 410, 354, 355, 287, 359, 365, 349]"
1744,ROMANCE,80,Neutral, He never asked why Aziraphale did n’t just remove the flowers .,"[3, 108]","[287, 349]"
1744,ROMANCE,81,Negative," The optimistic part of him thought Aziraphale would n’t ever consider it , but an insecure voice in the back of his brain told him it might not be a good idea to bring it up , just in case Aziraphale decided he ’d be well shot of his love for Crowley after all .","[3, 9, 108]","[287, 410, 349, 378, 386]"
1744,ROMANCE,82,Neutral, Crowley did n’t know what Aziraphale was telling Heaven had happened to his bodies .,"[9, 3]","[410, 287, 475]"
1744,ROMANCE,83,Neutral," Probably something about being bested by his demonic adversary , which was , in many ways , true .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,84,Neutral," In any case , Aziraphale only tended to start hacking up plant matter around him , which meant he was always around to dispose of the body .",[9],"[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,85,Negative," An empty celestial corporation could be a powerful tool in the hands of the right magician , so he had to be careful .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,86,Positive," Aziraphale wound up in a lot of paupers ’ graves , or cremated , or tossed in a bog in the hope that nobody would ever find him .","[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,87,Neutral," In the seventeenth century , Crowley gave into temptation and let the Lord Chamberlain ’s Men use his skull as a stage prop .","[9, 151]","[421, 410, 424, 425]"
1744,ROMANCE,88,Neutral," Aziraphale had been rather fond of Will , he reasoned , and _ Hamlet _ had been one of his favorites .","[3, 154, 9]","[287, 430, 431, 410, 437]"
1744,ROMANCE,89,Neutral," Naturally , when Aziraphale came back and found out , he was incensed .","[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,90,Negative," He did keep the skull , though , and for centuries after it sat on his mantle next to a morning glory he ’d coughed up , pressed , and framed as a bit of a private joke .",[9],"[440, 441, 410, 450]"
1744,ROMANCE,91,Neutral," After the Antichrist arrived on Earth , Crowley did n’t know who was going to discorporate first : Aziraphale from his petal - choked respiratory system , or Crowley from a stress - induced stroke .","[165, 9]","[451, 410, 453, 592, 456]"
1744,ROMANCE,93,Neutral," But Aziraphale apparently could n’t afford to think about his feelings , either .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,94,Positive," He needed to believe Heaven would n’t actually end the world if the Antichrist turned out alright , so he could n’t admit any of the things that came with loving Crowley and being loved by him in return .","[175, 9, 3]","[410, 287, 475, 592]"
1744,ROMANCE,95,Negative," Raising the Antichrist themselves could only hasten the progress of Aziraphale ’s condition , so Crowley brought in the demon Ashtoreth to be the nanny and Aziraphale recruited St. Francis ( ironically ) to be the Dowlings ’ gardener .","[180, 3, 9, 185]","[287, 410, 592, 484, 488, 490, 491]"
1744,ROMANCE,96,Negative," Outside of meetings pertaining to the Arrangement , Crowley made it crystal clear to Aziraphale that they were not to see each other , and that this was for Aziraphale ’s own good , because he cared for him very deeply and did n’t want to see him discorporate before they could finish their work .","[9, 189]","[410, 287, 519, 503]"
1744,ROMANCE,98,Neutral," He ’d cough up a single petal here or there on top of busses , or , to Aziraphale ’s consternation , during symphonies and plays .",[9],"[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,99,Negative, But until their trip to Tadfield Manor his condition remained more or less stable .,[9],"[517, 519, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,101,Neutral," “ There ’s something odd about this area , ” said Aziraphale .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,105,Neutral, The Bentley slowed again .,[200],[563]
1744,ROMANCE,109,Neutral, said Crowley .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,110,Neutral, Aziraphale stared at him .,"[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,111,Neutral," “ Love , ” he said .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,113,Neutral," Crowley froze , his eyes fixed to Aziraphale when they really should have been on the road .",[9],"[410, 287, 548]"
1744,ROMANCE,115,Neutral, Aziraphale cleared his throat and swallowed something down .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,116,Positive, “ There seems to be this great sense of — “ He put a closed hand to his mouth and coughed politely .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,119,Positive," Again he coughed , this time harder , and a cascade of spittle - coated petals fell onto Crowley ’s nice leather seats .","[212, 3]","[410, 287]"
1744,ROMANCE,120,Negative," If he had n’t hit the woman on the bike , Crowley might have lost it .","[9, 3]","[410, 573, 287]"
1744,ROMANCE,121,Neutral," He might have screamed , pulled the car over , and kissed Aziraphale right there and then just to shut him up .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,122,Negative," And over the next few days , while Aziraphale did whatever he was doing to find the Antichrist and Crowley paced around his flat , he played the words over and over again in his head .","[3, 221, 9]","[580, 287, 410, 592]"
1744,ROMANCE,124,Negative," Now , on top of the missing Antichrist , the impending end of the world , and the threat of Hell breathing down his neck , Crowley had to worry that Aziraphale was going to choke himself to death over his very stupid , _ very reciprocated _ feelings of love .","[228, 9, 3, 231]","[591, 592, 410, 287, 599, 646]"
1744,ROMANCE,125,Neutral," His bloody - minded devotion to Heaven would eject him right back up there , and Crowley would have to face all of it alone .","[9, 231]","[410, 610, 646, 637]"
1744,ROMANCE,126,Neutral," He was right , in the end .",[231],[646]
1744,ROMANCE,127,Negative," He would n’t find out until much later just how right he was , that Aziraphale had dithered for hours coughing up gardenias until his mouth tasted like a romantic bingo night at a retirement home , torn between calling Crowley and calling Heaven .","[3, 240, 231]","[287, 619, 410, 622, 646, 625]"
1744,ROMANCE,128,Negative," But he ’d picked Heaven in the end , and it was fire that did him in , so Crowley was able to walk away from the bookshop certain that it had n’t been his fault .","[9, 231]","[410, 646, 637]"
1744,ROMANCE,129,Negative," He was still rather distraught about the whole thing , but you had to take your silver linings where you could get them .",[231],"[674, 664, 646]"
1744,ROMANCE,131,Neutral," It was n’t until they were sitting side by side in the jeep , the dark Chiltern Hills rushing by to the tune of Handel ’s Water Music , that they realized how unusual it was that their serenity was n’t being punctured by any hacking coughs .",[251],"[652, 654, 664, 659, 661, 663]"
1744,ROMANCE,132,Positive," After half an hour , Crowley finally worked up the courage to say something .",[9],"[666, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,133,Neutral, He cleared his throat .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,134,Neutral," “ Guess Adam cleared your lungs out , ” he said as coolly as he could .","[256, 9]","[673, 674, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,136,Positive," He took a deep , experimental breath .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,137,Neutral," “ Yes , ” he said slowly .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,142,Very positive, He laughed nervously .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,144,Neutral," “ Nuh , ” said Crowley .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,146,Neutral, Aziraphale glanced over at him .,"[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,149,Neutral, he squeaked .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,151,Neutral, Crowley took a moment to compose himself .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,153,Negative," he repeated , his words careful and deliberate .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,155,Neutral, Aziraphale smiled .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,156,Negative," He reached over to the steering wheel and pulled Crowley ’s left hand off of it , bringing it down and holding it firmly between them .","[271, 3]","[721, 722, 287, 410, 727]"
1744,ROMANCE,157,Positive," “ Oh , my dear , ” he said , “ I do n’t think it ’s going to be much of a concern anymo — _ Good Lord , Crowley , watch the road !","[9, 3]","[410, 755, 287, 733]"
1744,ROMANCE,159,Negative," Crowley shouted , turning sharply to avoid hitting a tree .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,160,Negative," He stopped the car and sat there , panting .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,167,Neutral, He paused .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,169,Negative, Aziraphale wrinkled his nose with distaste .,[3],[287]

1744,ROMANCE,172,Neutral, He paused again .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,174,Neutral, Aziraphale smiled .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,176,Negative," he said , and when it became clear that his cursing had undone Crowley entirely , he closed the gap between then and met his lips eagerly .",[9],"[410, 789]"
1744,ROMANCE,177,Positive," They lingered there , Aziraphale ’s hot breath filling both their mouths , skin brushing and pressing against skin , and then Crowley pulled away .","[3, 9]","[287, 410, 796]"
1744,ROMANCE,178,Negative," “ Okay , okay , ” he said , sitting stick straight against the back of his seat .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,181,Positive," For a brief moment , Aziraphale seemed to consider whether teenaged wastrels had the right idea after all , but he thought better of it and nodded .",[3],"[287, 816]"
