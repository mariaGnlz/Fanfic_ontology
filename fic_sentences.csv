1744,ROMANCE,50,Neutral," Furthermore , he had eyes .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,51,Positive," Until Egypt he had n’t been certain that Aziraphale loved him , too , but he ’d always had hope .","[3, 9]","[229, 287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,52,Positive," Aziraphale , on the other hand , could n’t afford that hope .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,53,Neutral," To have hope that Crowley could love him would mean acknowledging that he and Crowley were the same , that Crowley did n’t deserve Hell any more than Aziraphale did — and perhaps that Aziraphale deserved it more , because deep , deep down , in a part of himself he ’d locked away , he did n’t believe in Heaven ’s inherent goodness anymore than Crowley did .","[9, 3, 84]","[410, 287, 246, 248, 253]"
1744,ROMANCE,54,Neutral," But Aziraphale could n’t let himself acknowledge that , because he was an angel .","[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,55,Negative," He was also a stubborn bastard , which was why he was so able to convince himself Crowley could n’t love him that he drowned in flower petals every time they got too close .",[9],"[410, 267]"
1744,ROMANCE,57,Positive," “ Angel , seriously , Heaven is going to start asking questions if you keep leaving corpses stuffed with daisies everywhere you go , ” said Crowley as he watched Aziraphale retch in an alley just off the Forum .",[9],"[410, 301, 287, 282, 283, 475]"
1744,ROMANCE,61,Neutral, Aziraphale looked up from the petals on the ground and glared at him .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,65,Neutral, He stood up straight and crossed his arms .,[103],[306]
1744,ROMANCE,67,Negative, Crowley let out a loud grunt of frustration .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,68,Negative," “ Would it really be so bad , Aziraphale ?",[3],"[287, 315]"
1744,ROMANCE,70,Negative," “ Perhaps , ” said Aziraphale , “ but it ’s not one to which you can be the solution . ”",[3],"[287, 324, 326, 301]"
1744,ROMANCE,71,Neutral," And then , as though underlining his point , he bent over and regurgitated an entire striped carnation .",[108],[349]
1744,ROMANCE,74,Neutral, Crowley shouted .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,76,Neutral," And with that , he stormed off .",[108],"[349, 336]"

1744,ROMANCE,78,Positive," He simply stared at Aziraphale , one eyebrow fixed condescendingly in place , and let the silence speak for him .",[108],"[287, 346, 349]"
1744,ROMANCE,79,Neutral," He did n’t say anything when he started coughing up bouquets of wallflowers as they sealed their Arrangement , or snowdrops when the commiserated over the fourteenth century , or hydrangeas when Crowley bit the bullet and moved from Italy to London to be closer to Aziraphale in the fifteenth .","[9, 108]","[352, 410, 354, 355, 287, 359, 365, 349]"
1744,ROMANCE,80,Neutral, He never asked why Aziraphale did n’t just remove the flowers .,"[3, 108]","[287, 349]"
1744,ROMANCE,81,Negative," The optimistic part of him thought Aziraphale would n’t ever consider it , but an insecure voice in the back of his brain told him it might not be a good idea to bring it up , just in case Aziraphale decided he ’d be well shot of his love for Crowley after all .","[3, 9, 108]","[287, 410, 349, 378, 386]"
1744,ROMANCE,82,Neutral, Crowley did n’t know what Aziraphale was telling Heaven had happened to his bodies .,"[9, 3]","[410, 287, 475]"
1744,ROMANCE,83,Neutral," Probably something about being bested by his demonic adversary , which was , in many ways , true .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,84,Neutral," In any case , Aziraphale only tended to start hacking up plant matter around him , which meant he was always around to dispose of the body .",[9],"[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,85,Negative," An empty celestial corporation could be a powerful tool in the hands of the right magician , so he had to be careful .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,86,Positive," Aziraphale wound up in a lot of paupers ’ graves , or cremated , or tossed in a bog in the hope that nobody would ever find him .","[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,87,Neutral," In the seventeenth century , Crowley gave into temptation and let the Lord Chamberlain ’s Men use his skull as a stage prop .","[9, 151]","[421, 410, 424, 425]"
1744,ROMANCE,88,Neutral," Aziraphale had been rather fond of Will , he reasoned , and _ Hamlet _ had been one of his favorites .","[3, 154, 9]","[287, 430, 431, 410, 437]"
1744,ROMANCE,89,Neutral," Naturally , when Aziraphale came back and found out , he was incensed .","[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,90,Negative," He did keep the skull , though , and for centuries after it sat on his mantle next to a morning glory he ’d coughed up , pressed , and framed as a bit of a private joke .",[9],"[440, 441, 410, 450]"
1744,ROMANCE,91,Neutral," After the Antichrist arrived on Earth , Crowley did n’t know who was going to discorporate first : Aziraphale from his petal - choked respiratory system , or Crowley from a stress - induced stroke .","[165, 9]","[451, 410, 453, 592, 456]"
1744,ROMANCE,93,Neutral," But Aziraphale apparently could n’t afford to think about his feelings , either .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,94,Positive," He needed to believe Heaven would n’t actually end the world if the Antichrist turned out alright , so he could n’t admit any of the things that came with loving Crowley and being loved by him in return .","[175, 9, 3]","[410, 287, 475, 592]"
1744,ROMANCE,95,Negative," Raising the Antichrist themselves could only hasten the progress of Aziraphale ’s condition , so Crowley brought in the demon Ashtoreth to be the nanny and Aziraphale recruited St. Francis ( ironically ) to be the Dowlings ’ gardener .","[180, 3, 9, 185]","[287, 410, 592, 484, 488, 490, 491]"
1744,ROMANCE,96,Negative," Outside of meetings pertaining to the Arrangement , Crowley made it crystal clear to Aziraphale that they were not to see each other , and that this was for Aziraphale ’s own good , because he cared for him very deeply and did n’t want to see him discorporate before they could finish their work .","[9, 189]","[410, 287, 519, 503]"
1744,ROMANCE,98,Neutral," He ’d cough up a single petal here or there on top of busses , or , to Aziraphale ’s consternation , during symphonies and plays .",[9],"[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,99,Negative, But until their trip to Tadfield Manor his condition remained more or less stable .,[9],"[517, 519, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,101,Neutral," “ There ’s something odd about this area , ” said Aziraphale .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,105,Neutral, The Bentley slowed again .,[200],[563]
1744,ROMANCE,109,Neutral, said Crowley .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,110,Neutral, Aziraphale stared at him .,"[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,111,Neutral," “ Love , ” he said .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,113,Neutral," Crowley froze , his eyes fixed to Aziraphale when they really should have been on the road .",[9],"[410, 287, 548]"
1744,ROMANCE,115,Neutral, Aziraphale cleared his throat and swallowed something down .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,116,Positive, “ There seems to be this great sense of — “ He put a closed hand to his mouth and coughed politely .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,119,Positive," Again he coughed , this time harder , and a cascade of spittle - coated petals fell onto Crowley ’s nice leather seats .","[212, 3]","[410, 287]"
1744,ROMANCE,120,Negative," If he had n’t hit the woman on the bike , Crowley might have lost it .","[9, 3]","[410, 573, 287]"
1744,ROMANCE,121,Neutral," He might have screamed , pulled the car over , and kissed Aziraphale right there and then just to shut him up .",[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,122,Negative," And over the next few days , while Aziraphale did whatever he was doing to find the Antichrist and Crowley paced around his flat , he played the words over and over again in his head .","[3, 221, 9]","[580, 287, 410, 592]"
1744,ROMANCE,124,Negative," Now , on top of the missing Antichrist , the impending end of the world , and the threat of Hell breathing down his neck , Crowley had to worry that Aziraphale was going to choke himself to death over his very stupid , _ very reciprocated _ feelings of love .","[228, 9, 3, 231]","[591, 592, 410, 287, 599, 646]"
1744,ROMANCE,125,Neutral," His bloody - minded devotion to Heaven would eject him right back up there , and Crowley would have to face all of it alone .","[9, 231]","[410, 610, 646, 637]"
1744,ROMANCE,126,Neutral," He was right , in the end .",[231],[646]
1744,ROMANCE,127,Negative," He would n’t find out until much later just how right he was , that Aziraphale had dithered for hours coughing up gardenias until his mouth tasted like a romantic bingo night at a retirement home , torn between calling Crowley and calling Heaven .","[3, 240, 231]","[287, 619, 410, 622, 646, 625]"
1744,ROMANCE,128,Negative," But he ’d picked Heaven in the end , and it was fire that did him in , so Crowley was able to walk away from the bookshop certain that it had n’t been his fault .","[9, 231]","[410, 646, 637]"
1744,ROMANCE,129,Negative," He was still rather distraught about the whole thing , but you had to take your silver linings where you could get them .",[231],"[674, 664, 646]"
1744,ROMANCE,131,Neutral," It was n’t until they were sitting side by side in the jeep , the dark Chiltern Hills rushing by to the tune of Handel ’s Water Music , that they realized how unusual it was that their serenity was n’t being punctured by any hacking coughs .",[251],"[652, 654, 664, 659, 661, 663]"
1744,ROMANCE,132,Positive," After half an hour , Crowley finally worked up the courage to say something .",[9],"[666, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,133,Neutral, He cleared his throat .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,134,Neutral," “ Guess Adam cleared your lungs out , ” he said as coolly as he could .","[256, 9]","[673, 674, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,136,Positive," He took a deep , experimental breath .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,137,Neutral," “ Yes , ” he said slowly .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,142,Very positive, He laughed nervously .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,144,Neutral," “ Nuh , ” said Crowley .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,146,Neutral, Aziraphale glanced over at him .,"[3, 9]","[287, 410]"
1744,ROMANCE,149,Neutral, he squeaked .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,151,Neutral, Crowley took a moment to compose himself .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,153,Negative," he repeated , his words careful and deliberate .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,155,Neutral, Aziraphale smiled .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,156,Negative," He reached over to the steering wheel and pulled Crowley ’s left hand off of it , bringing it down and holding it firmly between them .","[271, 3]","[721, 722, 287, 410, 727]"
1744,ROMANCE,157,Positive," “ Oh , my dear , ” he said , “ I do n’t think it ’s going to be much of a concern anymo — _ Good Lord , Crowley , watch the road !","[9, 3]","[410, 755, 287, 733]"
1744,ROMANCE,159,Negative," Crowley shouted , turning sharply to avoid hitting a tree .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,160,Negative," He stopped the car and sat there , panting .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,167,Neutral, He paused .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,169,Negative, Aziraphale wrinkled his nose with distaste .,[3],[287]

1744,ROMANCE,172,Neutral, He paused again .,[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,174,Neutral, Aziraphale smiled .,[3],[287]
1744,ROMANCE,176,Negative," he said , and when it became clear that his cursing had undone Crowley entirely , he closed the gap between then and met his lips eagerly .",[9],"[410, 789]"
1744,ROMANCE,177,Positive," They lingered there , Aziraphale ’s hot breath filling both their mouths , skin brushing and pressing against skin , and then Crowley pulled away .","[3, 9]","[287, 410, 796]"
1744,ROMANCE,178,Negative," “ Okay , okay , ” he said , sitting stick straight against the back of his seat .",[9],[410]
1744,ROMANCE,181,Positive," For a brief moment , Aziraphale seemed to consider whether teenaged wastrels had the right idea after all , but he thought better of it and nodded .",[3],"[287, 816]"

3087,ROMANCE,29,Positive," Also , aparently , time had erased a great deal of the terror of discovery , indeed , the annoyingly cocky , over confident , part of him was yelling that , hey , if he was getting a fun tour of all nine circles of Hell , he might as well earn the ‘ privilege ’ In for a penny , in for a pound and all that jazz .",[45],"[311, 778, 322, 326]"
3087,ROMANCE,30,Negative," Actually getting to putting any of that confidence anywhere productive takes longer than he ’d have liked , not only because , pretty predictably , said confidence flees the moment he actually commits , but also , shamefully , because he wants to make sure he ’s not just going to frighten the Angel off .",[45],"[778, 606]"
3087,ROMANCE,31,Neutral," He has , after all , been lucky enough to get in on the pining lark right at the beginning when the Angel had still been fine tuning his powers and thus had already been written off with the rest of the ‘ background noise ’ by the time that a ) the Angel had gotten his stride and b ) said pinining had become desperate yearning .","[104, 45, 106]","[778, 606]"
3087,ROMANCE,33,Negative," Loving something in the vague , angelic , sense was not , after all , the same as Loving it the human way and not even he ’d been stupid enough to indulge the fantasy that there was anything but column a involved in the Angel ’s interactions with him .",[45],"[382, 778, 606]"
3087,ROMANCE,34,Negative," When , the liberal application of causual wording , the implication that , maybe , this was all temptation and the obvious demonic influencing of a coin toss , the Arangement had come in to being he ’d sort of hoped that ’d be a good bit of closure .",[45],"[633, 778]"
3087,ROMANCE,35,Negative," That knowing he could see the Angel at least weekly to not only talk about work , but also simply just to talk , would be just enough to at least make the yearning bearable again .",[45],"[387, 390, 778, 606]"

3087,ROMANCE,41,Negative," Allows him to retain some molecule of sanity after his stupid panic mouth suggests raising the honest to Satan antichrist with the Angel which , in turn , means he ’s able to take the Angel actually agreeing as the typically soft hearted , passifistic , choice it actually is rather than reading things into it .",[45],"[778, 471, 472, 606, 480]"
3087,ROMANCE,42,Positive," Every single one of the next eleven years is started a strong , strong , reminder that the Angel regards this whole affair as little more than another business interaction , that letting himself get comfortable once had cost him a little the Angel 's trust and , finally , that the last they ’d spent this much time together he ’d been lying to himself the truth of his Feelings .",[45],"[481, 482, 778, 487, 606, 496]"

3087,ROMANCE,48,Negative," That he goes limp and simply lets himself be pushed , seems even , perhaps , to be tempted a moment to twist the entire encounter into precisely what it gets mistaken for in the end .",[45],"[556, 778]"

12761,FRIENDSHIP,73,Neutral, He still listened intently to whatever pearls of wisdom Crowley was certain Aziraphale was wasting on him .,"[4, 138]","[125, 90]"

12761,FRIENDSHIP,87,Neutral, Crowley plucked at his cuticles as Aziraphale picked the conversation back up .,"[4, 6]","[125, 90]"
12761,FRIENDSHIP,88,Negative, After that it almost seemed as though Edward was frozen .,[113],"[457, 364]"
12761,FRIENDSHIP,89,Negative," He nodded as Aziraphale spoke , but his body did n't so much as twitch , and he had a rather maniacal grin pasted on his face .",[4],"[125, 90]"
12761,FRIENDSHIP,90,Negative," Then his eyes started rolling , searching .",[4],[125]
12761,FRIENDSHIP,91,Negative," Almost as if he could hear voices , but could n't figure out where they were coming from , because they were coming from his own head .",[4],"[125, 384]"

16132,FRIENDSHIP,101,Positive," He dragged him toward the bookshop , walking backwards to drag Crowley , which was a little precious , as he kept thinking he would knock himself into something , but looking behind him from time to time worked fine in avoiding any bumps .",[109],[950]

16132,FRIENDSHIP,150,Neutral," He could think of one thing though , so he grabbed the nearest blanket and draped it over him .",[53],"[563, 1296, 731]"
16132,FRIENDSHIP,151,Negative," The computer was in the other room , but he did n’t really want to leave Crowley alone , in case he wakes up and does n’t know where he is again , or in case he just does something stupid , which would be very on key for his kind of character .","[109, 53]","[950, 1296]"
16132,FRIENDSHIP,152,Positive," Though , he thought , was n’t the computer Crowley bought him some kind of ‘ laptop ’ ?","[254, 53]","[950, 1296]"

16132,FRIENDSHIP,157,Negative," It took him a little bit to find the ‘ search bar ’ , and he took a little more time than he should have typing in his query , but finally he was satisfied with the “ how would one treat a shivering wet and cold demon ? ”",[53],"[611, 612, 1296]"
16132,FRIENDSHIP,158,Neutral, And he pressed enter .,[53],[1296]

16132,FRIENDSHIP,198,Neutral, Crowley looked up hopefully .,[109],[950]
16132,FRIENDSHIP,200,Negative," He put down the underwear from Crowley ’s clothes pile , his warmest sweater , which happened to be his biggest one , and the longest socks he could find .","[313, 109]","[752, 950]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,44,Negative," The city beneath him was a blur of thatched roofs and grey stones as he fled , hell - bent on escaping what was sure to be a painful discorporation .","[4, 11]","[1414, 320]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,45,Very positive, He rather liked this body .,"[4, 0, 11]","[1414, 272, 320]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,46,Positive," He liked Earth much better than Hell despite the presence of roving gangs of angels , and he would rather stay here .",[4],"[194, 1414, 200, 309]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,48,Negative," He hated it , but that was the state of affairs , and running was the smartest thing to do failing any option that resulted in angels deciding they _ did n’t _ have to be out for his blood on sight .","[4, 67]","[207, 247, 1414, 214, 215, 309, 323]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,49,Neutral," Crowley dove beneath the rooftops , hoping that getting out of the angels ’ line of sight would give him more leeway .","[4, 67, 11]","[1414, 247, 320]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,50,Positive," He shrouded himself with a miracle to avert notice from humans below ; it divided his attention and slowed him down a little , but it was a calculated risk .","[67, 0, 11]","[225, 247, 272, 320]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,51,Neutral," Crowley ’s wingtips brushed the thatching on either side , nimble and quick , threading the needle through obstacles as he darted down alleyways and under the eaves of buildings .","[4, 67, 0]","[1414, 247, 272]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,52,Negative, He pressed himself into the underside of a gutter as a figure in white robes darted overhead .,"[67, 0]","[247, 220, 272, 225]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,66,Positive," The evidence he ’d accumulated so far had led him to believe things of God — churches , blessed objects and the like — usually did a number of unpleasant things to him .","[4, 0]","[1414, 356, 272]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,67,Negative," He ’d never seen a church bell in action on a demon , but he guessed he was about to find out .",[4],"[1414, 284]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,73,Neutral, Crowley tried to stay in the air .,[4],"[1414, 309]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,74,Neutral," He really tried , but the bell swung back around for a second booming , thunderous _ gong , _ and the sound grated against the very fibre of Crowley ’s being , his demonic core that reacted explosively to anything of God .",[4],"[350, 1414, 356, 299, 309, 301]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,75,Negative," Crowley tumbled head over heels , wings flailing , and cracked his head on the brickwork lining the alley into which he ’d fallen .","[4, 0]","[1414, 272]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,77,Neutral," He slammed into the ground , still clutching his ears .","[4, 112]","[1414, 305, 323, 309]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,78,Negative," The roar died down into a subdued , high - pitched ringing as the bell mercifully fell still , but the ache and tightness it had smashed into his chest was still there , making it hard to breathe .",[4],"[394, 1414, 311, 323, 317]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,79,Neutral," Crowley staggered to his feet , one hand on the wall , the other clapped onto the side of his head , blood leaking through his fingers .","[4, 11]","[1414, 396, 320]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,82,Positive, He only succeeded in tripping .,"[4, 117]","[1414, 330, 309, 333]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,96,Neutral," From the sound of the letter , it seemed that Crowley wanted to talk about something .",[4],"[1414, 493]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,97,Negative," Well , it must not have been anything very important , because Aziraphale had been waiting for three hours past their meeting time .",[150],"[1129, 491, 492, 493, 495]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,98,Negative," About two hours in , he ’d given up on self - restraint and started ordering small , guilty , “ I ’m - still - waiting - for - you - but - I - also - want - to - drink ” drinks , which had gradually turned into “ I - got - stood - up - did n’t - I ” denial drinks .",[150],"[497, 498, 1129, 503, 502]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,99,Negative," He finally gave in and grudgingly admitted Crowley was not coming , decided he ’d waited long enough , and ordered a final pint before leaving .","[4, 150]","[1414, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,100,Neutral, Had Crowley ’s invitation been a ruse ?,[163],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,101,Neutral," That demon was certainly crafty , but Aziraphale had n’t thought he would abuse what trust had developed between them for the sake of distracting Aziraphale for a few hours … would he ?",[150],"[1129, 515, 517]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,103,Negative," He pushed down the realisation that he was lonely , squashing it under another impressive helping of denial .",[150],"[1129, 529]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,104,Neutral," Gabriel was in town , after all ; there were more angels here than ever thanks to Gabriel ’s armed escort mucking about .",[170],[1164]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,105,Neutral," They did n’t really _ get _ him , though .",[150],"[547, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,106,Negative, Aziraphale had the nagging suspicion that something had prevented Crowley from making their rendezvous .,"[150, 4]","[1129, 1414, 547]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,107,Negative," Still , he could n’t drag his mind out of the rut that he was an idiot for trusting anyone , that his demonic nemesis * had duped him , and he really ought to get on with being alone for the rest of his life .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,108,Negative," [ * Aziraphale refused to use the word _ companion _ just yet , but he was working up to it . ]",[150],"[1129, 569]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,111,Negative, He ’d heard a church bell tolling not that long ago and had wondered what it ’d been for .,[150],"[588, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,112,Neutral," Three chimes was n’t the norm for Compline , and it was n’t any saint ’s day or other liturgical festival he could think of .",[150],"[582, 583, 584, 1129, 588]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,113,Neutral, He might as well investigate .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,114,Positive," And while he was there , he could visit with the priest there who always had some delicious fig cakes lying about … Heaven knew he did n’t have anything better to do .",[150],"[591, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,115,Negative," Aziraphale thought about flying to save time , but that would require a level of purposeful movement for which he could not muster up the motivation .",[150],"[1129, 600]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,116,Negative, Aimless walking seemed more befitting his restlessness and ill temper .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,118,Negative," Street - lamps had n’t been invented yet , so his lonely journey was guided by the cold , beautiful light of the stars as they started to twinkle on one by one .",[150],"[612, 613, 1129, 620]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,119,Positive," Aziraphale meandered down the street , his breath making small clouds before him , taking note when he passed a lit doorway through which he could see patrons of a bar or families content at dinner , laughing in the warmth and having a good time .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,120,Positive, He swiftly averted his eyes from such displays of happiness .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,121,Neutral, It was fully dark by the time he arrived at the church .,[150],"[647, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,122,Negative," It hardly seemed likely he would find anyone at this hour to ask why the bell had sounded , but he ’d been looking for the flimsiest excuse to go for a walk so it hardly mattered .",[150],"[646, 647, 1129, 654]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,123,Negative," He rubbed his hands together and gazed up at the tower , the bell ’s brass bulk looming like a gargoyle in the darkness .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,124,Negative, Aziraphale caught the coppery scent of blood and prickled with alarm .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,125,Negative," He glanced down and saw a glistening trail , which shone a washed - out , glossy black in the dimness of the alley .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,126,Positive, He squatted to examine it and noted it looked relatively fresh .,[150],"[1129, 673]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,128,Neutral, he called .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,130,Negative," He jogged towards the church , peering around to try to find the source of the blood .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,132,Neutral, Aziraphale ’s neck prickled again as he sensed an otherworldly aura nearby .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,135,Negative, Aziraphale ’s blood boiled to imagine that Crowley would have the gall to dupe him so he could go off to do … .,"[150, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,139,Neutral, he whispered .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,141,Neutral," He knew how to use edged weapons , of course , but he strongly preferred keeping them out of his work .",[150],"[1129, 713]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,143,Negative," He was a lot of things , but a fool was n’t one of them .",[150],"[712, 713, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,144,Negative, He stepped forwards gingerly to avoid staining his sandals with the blood splattered all over the ground .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,145,Negative," A ghastly wheeze to one side drew his attention , and Aziraphale saw who ’d made it : Crowley was crumpled on the ground , bracing himself against the wall , his head hanging .","[150, 4]","[723, 1129, 1414, 735]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,146,Negative," It was immediately obvious to Aziraphale the blood was _ his , _ not that of a victim .",[150],"[1129, 737]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,147,Neutral, He looked like he ’d gotten the business end of a sword between the ribs .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,148,Positive, The presence of some stray nicks here and there on his arms and face told Aziraphale he had at least put up a fight .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,149,Negative," At first , Aziraphale thought he ’d stumbled upon Crowley ’s corpse , but the laboured breaths powering the wheezing told him otherwise .","[150, 252]","[757, 1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,150,Negative, He suddenly understood the off - hand comment Crowley had once made about angels smiting harder than strictly necessary .,"[4, 150]","[1414, 766, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,151,Negative, He ’d always thought it was an exaggeration to garner pity .,[150],"[770, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,152,Negative," Aziraphale _ did _ feel sorry for him now , which he did n’t want to admit .",[150],"[1129, 775]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,153,Positive," Surely if Gabriel ’s cohort had been after an execution , a quick throat - slitting would have been sufficient .",[263],[1164]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,154,Negative," But they had left him to die slowly , and by a church of all places .",[150],"[785, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,155,Negative," Aziraphale was n’t sure what effect being so close to holy ground would have on an injured demon , but judging by the trail of blood , Crowley had made some attempt to drag himself away from it before giving up and falling into his current position .","[150, 4]","[1129, 1414, 790, 798]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,156,Neutral, Aziraphale was torn on what to do .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,157,Negative," The angelic , and probably merciful , thing to do would be to put Crowley out of his misery .",[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,158,Negative, It would n’t be so bad ; Hell would just give him another body .,[4],"[806, 807, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,160,Positive," Those of angelic stock were made of sterner stuff than humans , so he would n’t die right away .",[274],[819]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,161,Negative, But he definitely _ was _ going to die .,[274],[819]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,162,Negative," It looked like Crowley had made an attempt to heal himself , but in his weakened state had clearly not been able to draw up enough power to do the job .",[4],"[1414, 821]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,164,Negative," That left only the option to kill him quickly , right ?",[4],"[835, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,165,Neutral, Aziraphale cleared his throat .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,166,Negative, Crowley did n’t respond ; his eyes were squeezed shut .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,168,Neutral," Aziraphale said , lowering the knife .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,169,Neutral, Crowley started and looked up at Aziraphale foggily .,[4],"[1414, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,172,Negative," Crowley reached up and stuck his pinky finger into his ear , twisting it .",[4],"[1414, 871]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,173,Negative," It was at this point Aziraphale noted the dried blood caked on the side of his face , trailing down from his ear .",[150],"[1129, 871]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,175,Negative," Aziraphale looked doubtfully up at the bell tower , then back down at him .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,176,Neutral, Crowley ’s serpentine tongue flicked out as he took his next laboured breath .,"[4, 150]","[1414, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,178,Neutral, Aziraphale again raised his knife .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,179,Negative, Crowley spewed some blood with a raspy cough .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,180,Positive," _ He probably has a punctured lung , _ Aziraphale thought .",[4],"[1414, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,182,Negative," Aziraphale did n’t respond , so Crowley closed his eyes again and titled his head back , baring his throat for the death blow .","[150, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,183,Neutral," Aziraphale grimaced , weighing the dagger in his hand .",[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,184,Negative," Merciful or not , he hated the idea of using it on someone who had never done him any harm .",[150],"[912, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,185,Negative," Aziraphale watched as Crowley ’s face tightened in despair when no blow came , and he realised Crowley shared the thought of a quick death being the best option .","[150, 310, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,187,Neutral, “ Gabriel ’s guard detail did this to you ? ”,[313],"[1164, 937]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,188,Neutral, Aziraphale asked .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,189,Negative," “ If you ’re not going to help me , then get out of here , ” Crowley snapped , chest heaving in palpable discomfort .",[4],"[1414, 937, 1002]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,190,Positive," He writhed for a moment , then finished , “ I ’m very busy dying . ”",[4],"[1414, 1002]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,191,Neutral, Aziraphale squatted down next to Crowley .,"[150, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,194,Neutral, Crowley let out a strangled laugh .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,195,Negative," He ’d recently been given a very stern and painful reminder of what his relationship with angels was supposed to be like , and he ’d discarded the plan he ’d been about to present to Aziraphale .",[4],"[955, 956, 1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,197,Negative," Trapped by his mounting guilt and indecision , Aziraphale did n’t budge .","[150, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,198,Neutral," “ Hey , ” said Crowley , his voice thick .",[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,201,Neutral," You always seemed a decent enough guy … ” Aziraphale waited for some confirmation that Crowley was mocking him , but none came .","[4, 150]","[1414, 1032, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,202,Neutral, Aziraphale looked at the knife in his hand again .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,203,Neutral, Crowley succumbed to another wet coughing fit .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,204,Negative, Aziraphale really did n’t want to kill him .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,206,Neutral, Had he come to … like this demon ?,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,207,Neutral, Maybe he could sort those feelings out later .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,208,Neutral, But was the alternative to just leave him … ?,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,209,Positive," “ I ought to at least move you somewhere more comfortable , ” said Aziraphale .",[150],"[1129, 1002, 1032]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,223,Negative," Surely now they were far enough away from the church that Crowley would n’t be affected by the holy ground , but if he just left him out here in the open , he might again catch the attention of Gabriel ’s escort , and human passersby could n’t help him .","[4, 364]","[1048, 1414, 1050, 1051]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,276,Negative, Crowley ’s dread at the thought of being discorporated suddenly made sense to Aziraphale .,[4],"[1414, 1267]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,292,Positive, It seemed so perfectly natural that it took him a moment to remember they were supposed to be enemies and therefore _ not _ help each other .,[4],"[1312, 1414, 1315]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,293,Negative," “ But you ’re not going to , ” Crowley grunted , baring his teeth in a strained sneer .",[4],"[1414, 1321]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,304,Negative," Usually it was n’t a problem , because of course an angel would _ trust _ another angel trying to heal them , but a demon … Aziraphale could do permanent damage to Crowley if he was n’t careful .",[4],"[1414, 1377, 1382]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,305,Neutral," Or if he were inclined to do so , which he was n’t , but Crowley would probably take some convincing on that front .",[4],[1414]

17484,FRIENDSHIP,326,Neutral, Aziraphale withdrew immediately .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,327,Negative," He was disappointed , but not entirely surprised , that Crowley had closed himself off after what he ’d just gone through .","[4, 150]","[1414, 1129]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,329,Positive, But just because Aziraphale had strange and illogical feelings of fondness for his adversary did n’t mean they would be reciprocated .,[150],"[1129, 1500]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,330,Negative, He ’d been foolish to think otherwise .,[150],[1129]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,331,Negative," “ All right , ” muttered Aziraphale , heaving himself up and dusting his tunic off .","[518, 150]",[1129]

17484,FRIENDSHIP,338,Negative, Why that pesky angel had n’t just killed him was a mystery .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,339,Negative," He either had some severely misguided heavenly compassion , or he was toying with Crowley in a way neither of them had ever done to each other before .",[4],"[1414, 1547]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,342,Negative," _ Still , part of Crowley clung to every scrap of pain , knowing it was what was keeping him from Hell .",[4],"[1414, 1561, 1557]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,343,Negative," As soon as it stopped , as soon as he died , he would end up back there .",[4],"[1414, 1561]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,344,Positive, Crowley ’s eyes flew open as he felt a hand gently tilting his chin up .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,345,Neutral, Aziraphale ’s concerned face was a foot away from his own .,"[150, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,348,Negative, Crowley ’s eyes drifted down to the two pints the angel had brought .,[4],"[1414, 1577]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,349,Neutral," Optimistic of Aziraphale to think Crowley would be able to drink his , but the gesture did n’t go unnoticed .",[4],"[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,351,Negative," Crowley coughed again , struggling to talk past the blood in his throat , wondering how many sentences he had left to get out .",[4],"[1414, 1588]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,352,Negative," He looked up at the moonlit sky , stars visible through the branches of the apple tree above them .",[4],"[1414, 1599]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,353,Positive, It was so utterly quiet and utterly beautiful … Crowley was glad he was here and not burning in an alley near a church .,[4],"[1414, 1604]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,354,Negative," “ Not a bad … spot … you picked out for it … angel , ” he said , chest heaving .",[4],"[1668, 1607, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,355,Positive," “ Thanks … ” Crowley felt Aziraphale ’s soft , plump fingers brush his cheek .","[4, 557]","[1414, 1129]"

17484,FRIENDSHIP,359,Neutral, Crowley shuddered and pulled up what remained of his energy to fortify his aura ’s defence .,[4],[1414]
17484,FRIENDSHIP,360,Neutral, He trembled as he felt Aziraphale ’s aura brushing against his own once more .,"[565, 4]","[1634, 1414, 1129]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,361,Negative," The only time he ’d felt anything like this was when he ’d been smitten by other angels , but that was markedly less pleasant .",[4],"[1414, 1646]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,362,Neutral," Still , he redoubled his efforts to keep Aziraphale at bay ; the sensory memory of being so close to angelic power overwhelmed him with panic .","[150, 4]","[1129, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,363,Negative," The exertion racked him with wretched , moist coughs .",[4],[1414]

17484,FRIENDSHIP,373,Negative," Pity , and the helplessness of someone who can prevent needless suffering but was not being allowed to for reasons he considered foolish .",[4],[1414]

17484,FRIENDSHIP,375,Negative, Aziraphale could sever him from his connection to his body and leave him trapped in a dead corporation ; he could pull him out and put him in a bottle and block him from seeking reincorporation in Hell ; he could tear him apart from the inside out so this slow dying was happening simultaneously in two planes ; he could destroy whatever parts of Crowley he wanted ; he could sever his wings .,"[150, 4]","[1129, 1728, 1414]"
17484,FRIENDSHIP,376,Negative, He could violate him in any number of ways that Crowley threw back in his face with a defiant addendum : _ Is this foolish ?,[4],[1414]

17616,FRIENDSHIP,82,Negative, The knowledge hurt more than he would have expected .,[6],[110]
17616,FRIENDSHIP,83,Negative, So the angel had left without waiting for an explanation and then made it impossible for Crowley to make things right ?,[6],"[110, 475]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,84,Neutral," Yeah , he saw how it was .",[6],"[110, 475]"

17616,FRIENDSHIP,89,Neutral," Most people would choose to believe that being a demon Crowley would hold onto anger and a grudge , but that would be untrue .",[170],"[110, 502]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,90,Neutral, It was truer to state that being a demon Crowley was more likely to _ utilize _ anger and grudges than harbor them himself .,[171],"[507, 110, 509, 510]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,91,Neutral, In his mind there was simply too much to enjoy and see and do to waste it all on ill - feeling .,[6],"[512, 110]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,93,Negative," Be that as it was , it really only took Crowley two walks around the duck pond before he felt his anger cool and he could think again .","[173, 6]","[522, 523, 525, 110]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,94,Neutral, Sometimes he wondered what it would be like if their roles were reversed .,[6],"[110, 533, 534]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,95,Negative," If Crawly had never Sauntered Vaguely Downwards and instead stayed firmly on the side of Heaven , and if Aziraphale had taken the Fall instead and served the masters of Hell .",[2],"[536, 849, 538, 540, 541, 562]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,96,Neutral, In the farthest recesses of his mind he played with the possibility that their temperaments were more suited for the opposite side than for the one they were currently on .,[6],"[544, 110, 554, 553]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,97,Negative," But of course it was impossible to know , and if his superiors ever found those thoughts he would be in serious trouble .",[6],"[556, 110]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,99,Negative," It worried him , though .",[6],"[567, 110]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,100,Negative, Aziraphale was acting more like he had before their Arrangement -- more like the principality that Hell knew him as .,[2],"[849, 562, 574]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,104,Neutral, That Crowley knew definitely .,[192],[110]
17616,FRIENDSHIP,105,Negative," He was n't sure if it was actually possible to tempt Aziraphale to Hell now , although it had n't stopped the demon from attempting it occasionally over the last three thousand years .",[2],"[849, 581, 610, 583, 591, 562]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,106,Negative," It was a question that he 'd posed on random drunken nights , though , when the two of them were sequestered away in the back of the bookshop .",[2],"[590, 591, 849, 594, 595]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,109,Neutral," How could Lucifer fall in the firs ' place , huh ?",[202],[605]
17616,FRIENDSHIP,114,Negative," _ It was n't in an angel 's nature to behave like Aziraphale had , and it was n't in his best interest to do so , either .",[2],"[849, 631]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,115,Neutral, So it was up to Crowley to fix it .,[6],"[110, 631]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,116,Negative," He was a bad influence , and he knew it .",[2],"[849, 631]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,117,Neutral," He was a demon , he was supposed to be .",[2],[849]
17616,FRIENDSHIP,119,Negative," Yes , it was ever - frequently on Crowley 's mind whether angels could still fall six thousand years after the fact and he would hate to know the answer .",[6],"[110, 650, 656]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,122,Positive, With a decisive nod to himself he stopped in front of the closed bookshop door and studied the best route inside .,[224],[721]
17616,FRIENDSHIP,123,Negative," He was the Serpent , after all , and if he could n't find a way then he did n't deserve to be called demon .",[224],"[721, 668]"

17616,FRIENDSHIP,129,Negative, The air was stale and the musty smell of books was more powerful than ever but he did n't mind it .,[224],"[721, 709]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,130,Neutral," Finally maybe he could sit in peace and solitude and begin to recover the words that Crowley had erased from his books , but first he needed a cup of hot chocolate .","[6, 224]","[110, 712, 721]"
17616,FRIENDSHIP,131,Positive, He was heading to the back room to make himself just that when he felt the air shift .,[6],[110]

17641,FRIENDSHIP,0,Positive, ## The Disgruntled Angel Aziraphale was not in a good mood .,[0],[1]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,1,Neutral," Crowley could sense it from outside the bookshop , even from the sidewalk .",[1],"[101, 17]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,2,Negative," It was n’t that the “ Closed ” sign , which he often ignored anyway , was up in the middle of the afternoon on a Wednesday - that was common enough .",[1],"[7, 101, 11, 12, 17]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,4,Neutral," But as he stepped out of the Bentley , he instantly felt a. .","[5, 1]","[101, 21]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,7,Negative," Being Crowley , of course , he walked right in .","[8, 1]",[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,8,Negative," There was no sign of Aziraphale in the front of the shop , so he wandered among the shelves into the back room - and there he was .",[1],"[101, 269]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,9,Negative," He was sitting at his desk , hunched over , curled into as compact a form as it was possible for him to be .",[1],"[101, 44]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,10,Negative," Sure enough , the anger was stronger here ; Crowley could even see it a little if he squinted , in a red glowing corona surrounding Aziraphale .",[1],"[101, 48]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,12,Neutral, he finally said aloud .,[1],[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,13,Negative," Aziraphale did n’t even turn around ; clearly he was aware of Crowley ’s presence , but whatever was eating at him disturbed him far more than the demon .",[1],"[101, 269]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,14,Positive," * Trying to be nonchalant , ** Crowley sauntered around until he could get a good look at the angel ’s face ; the jaw was clenched , the lips tight , the eyes narrowed into small blue slits which stared ahead at nothing .",[1],[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,15,Negative, And clenched in his right hand was a small slip of paper .,[1],[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,16,Positive, A suspicion of what might be wrong with his ( definitely unofficial ) friend sparked in the demon ’s consciousness .,[1],[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,17,Negative," Slowly he reached out , having to use both hands to pry the paper out of his grip , and unfolded it , and his suspicions flamed with confirmation .",[1],"[83, 101]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,20,Neutral, he asked .,[1],[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,21,Neutral," He could have read the receipt more thoroughly , but it seemed important that he get Aziraphale to speak , instead of continuing to stare blankly ahead with that tightly - wound anger building inside him .",[1],"[99, 101, 104]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,22,Neutral," “ My Marlowe , ” was the tight reply .",[34],"[106, 107]"

17641,FRIENDSHIP,39,Positive," “ ... I ’m sure he ’ll give them a perfectly good home , ” said Crowley , despite knowing it would n’t do any good *** when the angel was in this kind of funk .",[1],"[101, 177, 171, 173]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,42,Negative," Aziraphale only sighed and morosely took the receipt back from him , smoothing it out for the accounts ; just because he was in a bad mood did n’t mean he was n’t going to be meticulous .",[1],"[269, 101, 104]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,43,Positive," Crowley felt the tiniest bit amused and / or exasperated ; he knew how precious the books were to Aziraphale , but if he did n’t want to have to occasionally sell them to stubborn and persistent customers , maybe he should stop running a bookshop , for heav - hel - earth ’s sake , and organize them into a private library or something .",[1],"[101, 196, 202]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,44,Neutral, Then he would n’t have to have these occasional post-sale blues .,[1],[101]
17641,FRIENDSHIP,45,Neutral," On the other hand , he thought he understood how the angel felt .",[1],[101]

17641,FRIENDSHIP,47,Neutral," **** Thinking about it like that , he just did n’t have the heart to give any kind of lecture or teasing , both of which were his usual go - to options for the angel .",[1],"[218, 219, 101]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,48,Positive," Finally he stepped a little closer to the desk and kind - of - sort - of leaned his hand on Aziraphale ’s shoulder in a way that he totally did n’t intend to be comforting , at all .","[76, 1]","[101, 269]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,50,Neutral," Then he asked , in his most placating tone , “ Want to get a drink ? ”",[1],[101]

17641,FRIENDSHIP,53,Negative," * * * * Of course , by now many things disturbed him far more than this particular demon .",[40],"[248, 269]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,54,Negative," Still , it bothered Crowley to not even be greeted by a “ Hello , dear boy . ”",[1],"[101, 271]"

17641,FRIENDSHIP,57,Neutral," *** Not that he wanted to start going around doing good , but you know .",[1],"[276, 101]"
17641,FRIENDSHIP,58,Negative," **** Of course , the circumstances would be somewhat different , because anyone foolhardy enough to covet the car would practically have to pry it from Crowley ’s cold dead fingers , and since he was more or less immortal , that would be next to impossible ; and in the unlikely event that they managed to get hold of it without killing him , they would have the demon hunting them down , with all the unrighteous wrath at his disposal , most likely before they had even gotten a block a","[90, 1]","[284, 101, 288, 300, 292]"

17643,FRIENDSHIP,0,Neutral, ## Camera Obscura Aziraphale was late .,[0],[1]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,1,Negative," Crowley had paced this wedge of the park , up and down the path , and crossed the footbridge over and back enough times to make the dark - coats - and - sunglasses types there look around nervously and walk off in different directions , presumably to meet at a second , uncompromised , rendezvous point .",[62],"[283, 3]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,2,Neutral," Of course he also had a dark coat and sunglasses , but that was different .",[62],"[14, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,3,Positive," Besides , he ’d already shed the coat , draping it over the back of the shady bench he ’d claimed near their favorite spot .",[62],"[283, 18, 22]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,5,Positive," He checked his watch again , and folded away the half - bag of bread he ’d brought for the ducks .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,7,Negative," He sat back on the bench , crossed his legs , and picked a bit of tree fluff off of his trousers .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,8,Negative, He was bored .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,9,Positive," He broke every second air conditioner from Madam Tussaud ’s to the London Eye , and , just for laughs , delayed the arrival of the repair workers by a combined average of nine hours .",[62],"[49, 50, 283, 53, 54]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,12,Neutral, Crowley winced as a girl tore past with a cry that would have done a kettle proud .,[62],"[283, 73]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,14,Positive," A boy lagged behind his friends and stopped , chest heaving , watching the ducks making their sleepy getaway as he gulped for air .",[24],"[768, 86]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,15,Neutral," At least , Crowley assumed it was a boy , as it was in that androgynous phase somewhere between “ infant ” and “ teenager . ”",[62],"[283, 97]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,17,Neutral," For the sake of convenience , he decided that the child was male .",[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,18,Neutral," And he was staring at Crowley , his sweaty , dirt - smeared face soft with wonder and curiosity .",[24],"[768, 104]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,20,Negative," He held child ’s gaze for just a beat too long , and it had been misinterpreted as an invitation of some sort .",[24],"[768, 140]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,21,Negative," The boy ’s shoes scuffed through the dust , kicking up leaf litter and small bits of bark as he walked up , stopping a good arm ’s length away .",[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,24,Negative, Crowley turned his gaze back to the ducks as they glared balefully at no one in particular and slipped into the water with quiet splashes .,[62],"[283, 135, 136]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,25,Negative," He rolled up his sleeves , silently blessed at Aziraphale ’s lack of a mobile phone and somewhat casual ideas about time , and promised himself that first thing tomorrow , he was buying the angel a phone .",[62],"[141, 142, 283, 146]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,26,Neutral, And teaching him how to use it .,[62],"[283, 157]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,28,Positive," For good measure , he counted out another minute or so .",[62],"[164, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,30,Positive," The beauty of it was , he did n’t have to actually do anything except enjoy it .",[62],"[185, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,32,Neutral," When he looked back up from his sleeve , the boy was still there .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,33,Positive," Crowley briefly considered simply getting up and walking away , but he was feeling good , or at least less bored , and there was a kind of defeat in being chased off his bench by a sweaty child with no manners .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,34,Neutral, He picked a speck off of his coat .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,35,Positive, Aziraphale would have known what to do with him .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,36,Negative," Or , knowing Aziraphale , maybe not .",[64],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,37,Negative," “ Your friends have gone , ” he said , and realized that it possibly sounded more sinister than he ’d really intended , but no matter .",[62],"[283, 211]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,38,Neutral," Idly , he wondered how long he ’d keep standing there like that if his shoes were suddenly filled with beetles .",[62],"[283, 215]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,40,Positive," The boy considered for a moment , pushing damp hair back from his face , smearing more dirt artlessly across his forehead .",[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,42,Neutral, Crowley pushed his sunglasses up and arched an eyebrow at the boy .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,45,Neutral," Crowley went very still for a span of twenty or thirty heartbeats , steadfastly resisting the urge to check his sunglasses again .",[62],"[283, 242, 243]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,46,Neutral," “ I do n’t have _ any _ shadow right now , ” he said finally , nodding at the shade .",[62],"[249, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,47,Neutral, The boy gave a quick shake of his head and pushed the hair back out of his eyes .,[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,48,Neutral, Fear and a burning curiosity rolled off of him .,[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,51,Neutral, Crowley was getting an odd feeling about this ; surely he ’d filled his _ creepy child _ quota for … forever .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,53,Positive, His heart thudded away inside his chest ; he reminded it firmly that it did n’t actually need to do that .,[62],"[283, 291, 292]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,54,Negative," There was a bit of a pause as he considered and rejected several answers before saying , “ No . ”",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,56,Positive," That was easy ; perhaps Aziraphale was right , and honesty was sometimes best .",[62],"[283, 299]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,57,Negative," He ’d never tell the angel that , of course .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,58,Positive," Reflexively , he made to check his watch again , but was n’t really focusing on the dial .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,61,Neutral," Since Crowley was , by most measures , an oddity , they sometimes saw him for what he was .",[62],"[283, 319]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,64,Neutral, He recrossed his legs and folded his hands in his lap .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,66,Neutral, The boy sat on the bench beside him .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,69,Negative," The boy ’s legs were n’t quite long enough to reach the ground , and he swung his feet back and forth , toes scraping in the dirt .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,76,Neutral, Then he took a breath and soldiered on .,[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,78,Positive, Crowley almost laughed .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,82,Negative," The boy struggled with this for a long moment , the thoughts chasing themselves across his face .",[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,84,Neutral, Not an ounce of dissembling in him ; he wore it all right there on his grubby sleeve .,[24],"[768, 400]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,85,Positive, A fine line formed between his brows .,[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,87,Positive," If the kid wanted honesty , Crowley was happy to see how much he could take .","[62, 24]","[283, 768]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,88,Negative, He lowered his sunglasses and fixed the boy with a hard yellow gaze .,[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,93,Negative, Fear shimmered off the boy like heat from a summer road ; he bit his lip .,[24],"[424, 768]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,96,Neutral," He pushed his sunglasses up and pinched the bridge of his nose , rubbing at the corners of eyes .",[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,97,Negative," “ It just is , ” he said instead , not really wanting to dig in to Hell ’s bureaucracy and opportunities for downward mobility .",[24],"[768, 447, 451]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,99,Neutral," He ’d hold that in reserve for now , a sort of Plan C. “ For instance , I do n’t usually eat small children , but I might consider making an exception . ”",[24],"[456, 458, 462, 768]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,100,Negative," Plan … much further down the list , if only because Aziraphale would n’t speak to him for a century .","[62, 24]","[283, 467, 768]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,101,Neutral, The boy wiped his nose on his arm and appeared to consider this new information .,[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,102,Negative, Crowley mentally mapped the location of every nicely child - free bar in the area and pushed himself up off the bench .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,103,Positive," In a robust display of inner strength , he walked out onto the bridge , and not toward any of the bars nearby which were probably pouring glasses of brandy at that very moment .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,105,Neutral, _ And Aziraphale would be along any moment now .,[62],"[283, 496]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,106,Neutral, He hoped .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,107,Positive," At this point the last of the ducks their would - be napping place , and followed him along the bridge , paddling along and quacking for a handout .",[62],"[502, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,109,Negative," He pulled out the now very squished bag of bread and tore off small pieces , tossing them absently down into the water .",[62],"[508, 512, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,110,Positive," Free of the shade , the sun felt good on his face ; he tipped his head back and basked in it .",[62],"[283, 796, 521]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,111,Neutral," A furtive glance over his shoulder revealed only the one shadow , thanks .",[62],"[524, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,112,Negative, Not that he was nervous .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,113,Positive," He breathed slowly ; the smell of wet , green things was very strong here , and insects hummed in the cooler shallows along the shore .",[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,114,Negative," The boy — Crowley briefly regretted not asking his name , but that moment had already passed , and really , it would have made this into something more serious than he wanted it to be ; it would have made the boy into a _ person _ and not just a random annoyance .",[62],"[283, 747, 543]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,115,Positive," And yes he recognized the hypocrisy in that , thank you .",[62],"[592, 283, 557]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,116,Positive, The boy trailed behind Crowley into the sunny spot along the bridge railing .,[62],[283]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,117,Positive," The fear in him was n’t gone , but it was faded , and the curiosity was still powerful .",[62],"[283, 564]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,118,Neutral, A combination like that could be stoked into all sorts of things when he was older .,[62],"[567, 283]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,120,Neutral," The boy shoved the hair out of his eyes again , and looked back down the path where his friends had gone .",[24],[768]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,122,Negative," “ My Gran says demons are bad , ” he said slowly .","[167, 169]","[587, 598]"
17643,FRIENDSHIP,125,Neutral," "" He passed the last of the bread to the kid , and leaned against the railing with both palms , watching the ducks fighting over the crumbs .",[169],[598]
17643,FRIENDSHIP,128,Neutral, He rubbed his fingertips against the underside of the rail .,[172],[612]
